# Graphics API

The Graphics API is a javascript interface between the Renderer and the Graphics (a [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)).

**TO BE WRITTEN. CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS CAN BE FOUND IN [../derived/typescript](../derived/typescript/README.md)**

Graphics are rendered in full-frame, ie they take up the entire screen.


It is recommended that Graphics SHOULD be designed to be responsive, ie support multiple resolutions and aspect ratios.
