# Work in progress notes

_This is a document where we can scribble down notes while working on this definition._

---


* We should split the manifest into { info, manifest }

## Uploading Graphic File


* Can it be a zipped file?
* Can file size be a problem?
* Should the upload url contain :id/:version? (Since it can be read from the file itself)


## Graphic

* Do we need to provide a base url to the GraphicInstance on load? So that it knows from where to load resources.
* Should the Graphic WebComponent be added to the DOM before or after calling the load() method?
